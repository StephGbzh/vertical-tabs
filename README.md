Vertical tabs is a Firefox add-on aimed at putting the tabs in a sidebar placed on the right of the browser.
It is *NOT* this add-on: [Vertical Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-Us/firefox/addon/vertical-tabs/)

I developed this because [Widefox](https://sites.google.com/site/jrweare/browser2.0) was abandoned around Firefox 3.
[Tab Mix Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-mix-plus/) developers never added this functionality either, see http://tmp.garyr.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17110

version 0.1
-----------

lib/main.js
data/main.css

Equivalent to my version of VertTabBar :
- tabs on the right
- buttons "tab list" and "new Tab" removed
- no drag and drop
